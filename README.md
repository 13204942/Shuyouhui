# README

Fangyijie Wang

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...

NOTE:
  1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment in config/environments/development.rb:
	config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }
  In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.
